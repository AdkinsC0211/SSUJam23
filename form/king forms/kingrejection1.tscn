text = "How dare you deny my requests? Do you not care for your kind's safety and his daughter's well-being? I should have you executed for daring to deny me. However, I shall not jump to such hasty action. It is your job to ensure our kingdom's coffers shall not go empty, and I trust that your rejection was only in the name of keeping our kingdom well stocked in coin. As such, I give you permission to allow our balance to dip lower than normal. After all, what good is coin with no king to spend it?
So be forewarned; future rejections will not be seen in such a forgiving light. I expect my request to take priority above all.
