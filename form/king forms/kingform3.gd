With a heavy heart and a vigilant gaze, I seek your esteemed approval to unfurl a plan of paramount import. A betrayer, veiled in the cloak of feigned allegiance, threatens the sanctity of my throne.

	In my pursuit to discern the insidious puppeteer, I entreat thee to liberate the necessary funds from our treasury to acquire a compendium of Eye Tomes, enchanted relics imbued with mystical sentience. These artifacts, silent observers in the tapestry of intrigue, shall clandestinely bear witness to every clandestine conversation and covert movement within the courtly shadows.
