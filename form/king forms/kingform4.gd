A nefarious undercurrent courses through the corridors of power, orchestrated by a clandestine cabal of traitors who cloak their sinister designs in elusive rhetoric, evading the watchful gaze of my Eye Tomes. To expose and thwart this malevolent conspiracy, I beseech your esteemed approval to allocate funds for the enlistment of a sorceress of unparalleled skill.

	This enchantress, adept in the mystical arts, shall be tasked with crafting enchanted stealth cloaks for a legion of spiesâ€”a chosen cadre whose success hinges upon the assurance of invisibility. These magical garments must be woven in utmost secrecy, shielding our intentions from the prying eyes of the traitors we seek to unveil. I implore you to disburse the necessary funds with expeditious diligence, for the timely revelation of the truth is not only our kingdom's shield but also its salvation.
