The imperative to unearth undeniable evidence necessitates a confession, a feat impeded by the unwavering loyalty of the captain's followers. To circumvent this steadfast allegiance, I propose recourse to the arcane arts wielded solely by the witches of the Southâ€”an ancient knowledge concerning mind-controlling parasites.

	I implore thee, release the required funds to secure the aid of these mystical practitioners. Understand that this course may seem an unconventional crossing into realms beyond, but the exigency of the situation compels us. The peace and prosperity of our realm hinge upon this decisive action.

	Rest assured, once the menace is vanquished, the influence of these otherworldly endeavors shall be promptly dispelled, allowing our kingdom to return to the tranquil path it once knew. I entrust this matter to your discerning wisdom, for our kingdom's fate hangs in the balance.
