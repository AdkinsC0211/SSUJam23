With the assurance of formidable man-to-man combat, a new adversary emerges—none other than the impervious castle itself. The castle's towering gates, if sealed when our decisive strike commences, threaten to quash our aspirations before they fully materialize.

	To overcome this formidable obstacle, we find ourselves in need of a siege weapon capable of breaching the impregnable fortress gates. The existing arsenal, formidable as it may be, falls short, for the castle was cunningly designed to withstand conventional siege tactics. As the adage goes, 'Don't get high on your own supply,' and thus, we must look to a bespoke solution—a siege weapon of unique design and construction. Fortuitously, one among my ranks has acquaintances with a brilliant inventor, capable of devising the requisite weapon. However, to materialize this strategic advantage, funds for the procurement of construction materials are imperative.
