The crown's negligence has persisted for too long, and we urgently require resources to rectify this dire situation. Our local blacksmiths, though skilled, demand payment. Thus, I implore you to allocate funds for a complete armor overhaul. The time for complacency is over; our troops deserve better.

	The crown's apathy threatens our efficacy on the battlefield. Under your stewardship, may the treasury prioritize the safeguarding of the realm by investing in the very bulwark that protects it—the Royal Guard. Perhaps the Royal Guard should do more thant protect this kingdome, but rule it as well.
