Our upgraded armor and weapons are ready, yet we seek an additional edgeâ€”an influx of funds to perfect explosive potions known as grenades. These volatile concoctions, in the skilled hands of local potion makers, will provide us with the means to swiftly and efficiently storm the castle.

	I implore you to allocate the necessary funds for the development of these explosive potions. This support is crucial for our mission to liberate the kingdom from disillusionment and pave the way for a leadership more attuned to the needs of the people.
