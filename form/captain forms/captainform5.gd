Beyond the need for superior weaponry and equipment, a strategic concern arisesâ€”the loyalty of key figures in the royal court. While we cannot remove them without destabilizing the kingdom, we must secure their allegiance to ensure a smooth transition.

	Understanding the pragmatic nature of such individuals, I request a final allocation of funds. A substantial sum will be employed to sway these influential figures with the persuasive power of currency. In the intricate dance of power, a well-timed coin can be more persuasive than a leader's decree.

	This final financial support is crucial to cement our path to rebirth. With your assistance, my rule promises to surpass the shortcomings of King Aric Ironheart's reign manifold.
