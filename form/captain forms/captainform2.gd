Mere sharpening won't suffice; we must seize control of magic for our benefit. I implore you to allocate funds for the crafting of enchanted swords, fortified with potent runes to outmatch rogue mages.

	This enhancement is not a luxury but a strategic imperative. It is with a sense of duty that I relay the growing discontent within the ranks, a sentiment shared by many who question the monarch's commitment to the kingdom. Perhaps the unveiling of our augmented strength will compel a reevaluation of priorities in the ivory tower.
